# YOLO_ALGORITHM_IMPLEMENTATION
This Repository uses YOLO Object Detection Algorithm and applies it on image format and on Live Video Stream.

# ============================

This project is using Python with major modules like Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, cv2, matplotlib, PIL etc.
For the better and enhanced performance of the model, it is adviced to run the model on GPU.
Also, the user have to download pretrained model weights and then have convert them into .h5 file.

The decleration of the repository holder and resources are also specified in the sources_for_project file as well as user/repository holder have the permit to use the the model and make changes in code, which is defined in LICENSE.

This repository holdes two codes one is for the implementation on images and another is for implementation on Live Video Stream and uses cv2 module for the purpose.

The code for making the video stream more presentable is under development but the user can implement and see the outputs on the command-line interface.
